# Rational Tangles App 🌐💻
## Description 📝
Welcome to the Rational Tangles App! This tool allows you to explore the fascinating world of Conway's rational tangles interactively.

## Features 🌟
### **Interactivity**
Manipulate tangles in real-time and observe how the associated rational numbers change.

### **Mathematical Education**
Ideal for teaching or learning about rational tangles, fractional numbers, and topology.

### **Easy to Use**
Simple and clear user interface.
